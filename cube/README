This project holds the cube definitions, guice modules, classes to perform IO on the cube and backfill processes 
to populate the cubes in a batch mode.

Inside bin/* you will find shell scripts and properties files for the various cubes in use.  
To run a backfill:
a) ensure your hadoop configuration in the bin/conf folder is correct for the environment you are running
b) modify the cube.properties that you are backfilling, observing the comments in the files
