# GBIF Metrics Cube

This project holds the cube definitions, guice modules and classes to perform IO on the cube, and backfill processes
to populate the cubes in a batch mode.

## Usage

The backfill scripts are most easily run from one of the cluster gateway machines. Inside bin/* you will find shell scripts
and properties files for the 4 cubes in use: density (maps_cube), occurrence (occurrence_cube, country
(dataset_country_cube) and taxon (dataset_taxon_cube).

To run a backfill:
a) ensure your hadoop configuration in the bin/conf folder is correct for the environment you are running (see the README in bin/conf)
b) modify the cube.properties that you are backfilling, observing the comments in the files
c) choose
````shell
./backfill.sh
````
to first build the cube jar and then run your backfill job, or
````shell
./backfill.sh -nobuild
````
if the jar has already been built.
