In order to run the backfills you'll need the following configuration files in this (/cube/bin/conf) directory:
- core-site.xml
- hbase-site.xml
- hdfs-site.xml
- mapred-site.xml
- yarn-site.xml
- country-occurrence-dataset-cube.properties
- occurrence-cube.properties
- taxon-occurrence-dataset-cube.properties

These are symlinked from gbif-configuration for the dev environment.  You could update the links to a different environment:

env=dev; ln -sf ../../../../gbif-configuration/metrics-ws/$env/conf/*-site.xml ../../../../gbif-configuration/cube-builder/$env/*[sl] .
